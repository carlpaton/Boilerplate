# Boilerplate

In the spirit of Ubuntu I have decided to put together boilerplate templates and references.

* [Docker](Docker/README.md)
* [Web API](Web%20API/README.md)
* [ASP.NET MVC](ASP.NET%20MVC/README.md)
* [.Net Core Console Application](.Net%20Core%20Console%20Application/README.md)

# Ubuntu

> "Ubuntu (Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù]) is a Nguni Bantu term meaning "humanity". It is often translated as "I am because we are," and also "humanity towards others", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity"
