# Boilerplate

In the spirit of Ubuntu I have decided to put together boilerplate templates, references and best practice examples as I understand them.

Developers should not just write code, we must strive to produce solutions that are flexible, well-crafted, and testable.

# Ubuntu

> "Ubuntu (Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù]) is a Nguni Bantu term meaning "humanity". It is often translated as "I am because we are," and also "humanity towards others", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity"

# Boilerplate

> "In computer programming, boilerplate code or boilerplate refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. It is often used when referring to languages that are considered verbose, i.e. the programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal jobs."
